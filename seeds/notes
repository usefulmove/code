seeds - simple note application

seeds:
notes sync with a remote database {it may make sense to use the google keep REST API (https://developers.google.com/keep/api/reference/rest/)}
each note will have a unique identifier

usage:
% seeds add Dave "this is a new note" <- adds new note to Dave category
% seeds Dave <- returns all notes on Dave category (with unique ids)
% seeds cats <- returns all note categories (e.g, Dave, Tom, Kristen)
% seeds edit 103 "updated note text" <- update note 103
% seeds del 103 <- delete note 103

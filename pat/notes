command line usage:  % pat filename

text file is transformed to the phat format ( parentheses are open ).

could this be an awk zsh script implementation?

pat is a shell script that calls awk on the file and takes the return file object,
then uses that transformed file object and removes trailing spaces by calling
the de_clean shell script.

define pat as a zsh shell script in TODO

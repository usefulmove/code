command line usage:  % pat filename

text file is transformed to the phat format ( parentheses are open ).

could this be an sed bash or zsh script implementation?

pat is a shell script that calls sed on the file and takes the return file object,
then uses that transformed file object and removes trailing spaces by calling
the de_clean shell script.

define pat as a zsh shell script and call either an sed command or vim script on the file passed to the pat command. within vim, the instructions would be:

:%s/(\([^ ]\)/( \1/g 
:%s/\([^ ]\))/\1 )/g

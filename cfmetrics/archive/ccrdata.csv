Replacement of complete assembly did not improve ease of adjustment. Removed key from both assemblies and noted that adjustment stiffness remained the same with either unit, with increasing stiffness as unit approaches smaller settings. Replaced entire control bar assembly and key within existing housing assembly to address excess wear in existing control bar assembly.

Remaining Issues:  I understand that the adjustment stiffness is in-spec when 30 in/lbs or less.

After reviewing the code, I believe this is an issue with the RC5 version of the code sent to the researchers for IRB use prior to release. I can’t find the same bug in the RC6 version of code released. And the issue wasn’t noticed during the Verification of the RC6 code.  If the inconvenience is significant enough, then we can update their software to RC6 once we have the RC6 compatible FES cables in-house.
